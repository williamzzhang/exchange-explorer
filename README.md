# Exchange Explorer
This is a MERN stack web app I made to track all the destinations me and my friends visit during our Jan 2023 exchange term.
We're all situated across a bunch of different schools in Europe, I personally will be at Copenhagen Business School. 

Using this app everyone will be able to review the various landmarks they visit for others to check out! I want each user to have a unique pushpin color so the map visualization would be able to track each individual's journey around Europe.
